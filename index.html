                <p>
                    I'm a Computer Science and Chemistry student at the University of Toronto, currently navigating the messy, fascinating intersection of quantum computing, machine learning, and synthetic biology. I just finished a summer internship as a bioinformatics software developer at <strong>Roche's R&D division</strong>, where I built computational infrastructure for their novel SBX nanopore sequencing platform. Before that, I completed my PEY co-op at <strong>Sanofi</strong>, developing high-throughput genomics pipelines and designing heuristics to distinguish real viral mutations from sequencing noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, I'm doing research with two groups. With <strong>Professor Nathan Wiebe</strong>, I work on theoretical quantum computing—specifically randomized quantum algorithms, combining qDRIFT time evolution with quantum phase estimation and zero-noise extrapolation to push what near-term quantum computers can do. With <strong>Professor Artur Izmaylov</strong>, I co-developed a sampling-based quantum diagonalization method using Q-SENSE  <em>ansätze</em>, creating the first practical pipeline that leverages seniority-structured states for NISQ-era electronic structure calculations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a Teaching Assistant for theoretical computer science and calculus courses. Few things are as satisfying as watching students crack dynamic programming or finally understand why P vs NP actually matters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But honestly? What gets me most excited is <strong>synthetic biology and AI</strong>. For the past three years, I've co-led the computational division of <strong>iGEM Toronto</strong>—the university's synthetic biology research team. We've won 4 Gold Medals and 2 Best Model Awards across four international competitions, building everything from phage engineering platforms to generative models for plasmid DNA. There's something uniquely satisfying about watching sequences you designed <em>in silico</em> actually work in a real biological systems.

                    As an avid "spooky action at a distance" enjoyer, I'm fortunate to be doing research with two quantum chemistry groups at UofT. With <strong>Professor Nathan Wiebe</strong>, I investigate quantum simulation algorithms for electronic structure Hamiltonians—specifically product formulas (Trotter-Suzuki, qDRIFT) and block-encoding methods (LCU, Qubitization). I developed a comprehensive framework combining qDRIFT time evolution with quantum phase estimation, implementing both QFT-based and Kitaev's iterative algorithms, plus a zero-noise extrapolation protocol using Chebyshev node sampling that eliminates systematic O(t²) errors.

                    With <strong>Professor Artur Izmaylov</strong>, I co-developed the first practical Sampling-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) pipeline using Q-SENSE <em>ansätze</em>. The key insight: seniority-structured states give you systematic control over which regions of Hilbert space actually matter for chemistry, dramatically reducing the classical post-processing workload. We designed numerical experiments connecting seniority control to sampling efficiency—it's beautiful when theory and numerics align. Manuscript in preparation.

                    <p>
                        Built the first open-source platform for engineering bacteriophage receptor-binding proteins using generative AI. The challenge: phages are incredibly specific about which bacteria they infect, determined by tail fiber proteins that recognize bacterial surface receptors. Traditional phage therapy requires months of screening to find the right phage for a patient's infection. We wanted to <em>design</em> phages instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I integrated <strong>ESM3</strong> (Meta's 98B-parameter protein language model) for sequence generation, <strong>Boltz-2</strong> for structure prediction and binding affinity estimation, and <strong>MCMC optimization with simulated annealing</strong> to navigate the protein fitness landscape. Our energy function balanced predicted binding to target receptors, reduced binding to wild-type receptors, structural confidence (pTM scores), and sequence novelty. BLASTp confirmed all generated sequences had &lt;40% identity to known proteins—we were genuinely exploring novel sequence space, not just interpolating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We experimentally engineered four <em>E. coli</em> phages with retargeted host specificity: two to recognize truncated R1 lipopolysaccharide instead of K12 glycans, two to bind OmpC instead of LamB protein receptors. The platform reduces phage screening time from months to days. Wet lab validation ongoing; manuscript in preparation.

                        Developed a generative model for designing <em>de novo</em> plasmid sequences—the circular DNA vectors that are fundamental to synthetic biology but notoriously hard to design from scratch. We trained a <strong>Mamba2</strong> state-space model (linear-time complexity beats transformers for long sequences) on 137,000+ plasmid sequences, with custom byte-pair-encoding tokenization and genomics-specific augmentations: reverse-complement and random circular crop strategies to respect the topological constraints of circular DNA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In vitro experiments demonstrated that generated plasmids successfully replicated in bacterial systems, confirming our synthesized origins of replication actually <em>worked</em>. Plasmid.AI is now the <strong>largest open-source toolkit for plasmid foundation models</strong>, and we're continuing to improve it.

                        Applied constraint-based metabolic modeling and linear optimization (Flux Balance Analysis, FSEOF algorithm) to predict genetic modifications that enhance bacterial metabolic network efficiency. Think of it as computational strain design: given a genome-scale model of <em>E. coli</em> metabolism, which genes should you knock out or overexpress to maximize production of your target molecule? We evaluated over 12,000 genetic variations. Won Gold Medal + Best Model Award.

Also spent a memorable week debugging why HADDOCK3 kept silently dropping carbohydrate residues during protein-glycan docking (I wrote a 20-page troubleshooting document about it—the kind of painful experience that teaches you what computational biology actually involves).

                    <h3>LABind-ESM: Protein Binding Site Prediction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most protein-ligand binding prediction methods treat the ligand as an afterthought—predicting sites from protein structure alone. LABind flips this with a ligand-aware approach that learns protein-ligand interactions simultaneously. We forked the original LABind architecture (Zhang et al., Nature Commun. 2025) and replaced the Ankh protein language model with Meta's ESM2-3B, upgrading from 1536-dim to 2560-dim per-residue embeddings. The hypothesis: ESM2's richer evolutionary patterns learned from larger-scale training might capture binding-relevant features that Ankh misses. Built collaboratively for CSC413 (Neural Networks) at UofT, this explores whether bigger protein language models actually translate to better binding site prediction—spoiler: sometimes yes, sometimes surprisingly no.

It's the computational equivalent of a mathematician doodling elliptic curves in lecture margins: structured notebooks on quantum algorithms interwoven with reflections on the nature of computation itself. Includes custom rendering functions for Hamiltonians in both explicit tensor product form and simplified algebraic notation. Named after Laplace's demon meets Schrödinger's cat, because quantum mechanics is fundamentally about what we can and cannot know.

                    <p>
                        Sequencing platforms report quality scores (Phred scores) that are supposed to represent error probabilities: Q = -10 log₁₀(p). But how do you choose the parameters of a Beta(α, β) distribution such that the average error probability across n reads satisfies a target quality threshold with high confidence? This project tackles that question using concentration inequalities—Hoeffding's inequality for distribution-free bounds, Chebyshev's inequality when variance information is available, and practical quantile estimation for real-world constraints. It's the kind of statistical rigor that bioinformatics pipelines assume exists but rarely implement. Includes derivations, simulations, and reusable functions for modeling quality scores probabilistically rather than just trusting whatever the sequencer reports.

                    But it hits different in Spanish:


                    <blockquote>
                        "Los metafísicos de Tlön no buscan la verdad ni siquiera la verosimilitud: buscan el asombro. Juzgan que la metafísica es una rama de la literatura fantástica. Saben que un sistema no es otra cosa que la subordinación de todos los aspectos del universo a uno cualquiera de ellos."

                    of fish.”

                    happiness of fish?”
                    Zhuangzi said, “You are not I, so whence do you know I don’t
                    know the happiness of fish?”
                    Huizi said, “I am not you, to be sure, so I don’t know what it is
                    to be you. But by the same token, since you are certainly not a fish,
                    my point about your inability to know the happiness of fish stands
                    intact.”
                    Zhuangzi said, “Let’s go back to the starting point. You said,
                    ‘Whence do you know the happiness of fish?’ Since your question
                    was premised on your knowing that I know it, I must have known
                    it from right here, up above the Hao River.'

Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.
